# Usage with redux

**edikit** ships with few helpers to integrate to redux, see <Link to="/docs/components/panes/#usage-with-redux">panes</Link>
and <Link to="/docs/components/notifications/#redux-integration">notifications</Link>.

The library relies on [`redux-observable`](https://redux-observable.js.org/) to manage side effects and async actions.
